# Unification Mainnet Helpers

Miscellaneous tools to help support the provisioning and maintance of EV can be found here.


## Revert

To revert all data, fetch the latest binary, and uses the lastest published 
genesis. Warning, this will destroy your chain data and catching up may take
a while.

```
python -m mainchain.upgrade revert
```


## Network upgrades

There is also a helper that support network upgrades

```
python -m mainchain.upgrade genesis 700000
```

The helper will wait until the specified block and then perform an upgrade.
