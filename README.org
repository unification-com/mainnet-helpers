#+STARTUP: SHOWEVERYTHING
* Unification Mainnet Helpers

Miscellaneous tools to help support the maintenance of Unification Mainnet EVs can be found here. This library can be customised to your own architecture by editing the ~const.py~ file.

** Defaults
Due to the complexity of the beast, these tools will only work with our standard environments. This library also only currently supports Linux. There is some room for differences that the codebase can be modified to handle.

To view what the expected defaults are:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.defaults show
#+END_SRC

All the helpers take a ~--machine~ option that loads custom values. These values are defined in the ~undmainchain.const~ module.
** Reset All
This command will wipe all your chain data, use the latest published und versions and genesis. Whilst it may take much time to catch up, this is a good fresh slate if needed.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.upgrade reset
#+END_SRC
*** Install a specific version

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.upgrade binaries 1.4.1
#+END_SRC

** Export to S3
*** Genesis Export 
The export helper will stop the EV, export the chain data to a JSON file and upload it to Amazon S3, and start the EV again.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.export genesis <HEIGHT> <AWSKEY> <AWSSECRET>
#+END_SRC

*** Chain Export
The entire chain can be compressed and exported to S3. Warning: chains can be large and uploading to S3 can incur cost.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.export chain <AWSKEY> <AWSSECRET>
#+END_SRC

** Network upgrades
There is also a helper that support network upgrades

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.upgrade genesis 700000
#+END_SRC

The helper will wait until the specified block and then perform an upgrade.

** Updating the app.config
A standard interface to updating config on any node is provided. Configuration can both be get and set. When setting the config, and backup is automatically made and the difference between the old and the new is rendered.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.config get-app-line pruning --machine=node1
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m undmainchain.cli.config set-app-line pruning syncable --machine=node1
#+END_SRC
