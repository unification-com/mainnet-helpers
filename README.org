* Unification Mainnet Helpers

Miscellaneous tools to help support the provisioning and maintance of EV can be found here.


** Revert

To revert all data, fetch the latest binary, and uses the lastest published 
genesis. Warning, this will destroy your chain data and catching up may take
a while.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m mainchain.upgrade revert
#+END_SRC


** Network upgrades

There is also a helper that support network upgrades

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python -m mainchain.upgrade genesis 700000
#+END_SRC

The helper will wait until the specified block and then perform an upgrade.
